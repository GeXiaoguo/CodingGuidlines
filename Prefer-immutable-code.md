# Immutable code is preferable for two main reasons
Immutability in code makes code simpler and enhances performance, particularly in concurrent programming scenarios, due to the reduced need for synchronization and the ability to leverage caching more effectively.

## 1. Reduce Code Complexity
 - **Predictability:** Immutable objects maintain their state, leading to fewer surprises and more predictable code.
 - **No Side Effects:** Functions using immutable objects don’t alter external state, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
 - **Easier to Test:** With immutable objects, tests can be more straightforward since the objects don't change state unexpectedly.
 - **Reduced Temporal Coupling:** Immutability lessens the importance of the order of operations, as the state doesn’t change, simplifying the logic flow.
 - **Easier to Reason About:** Following the flow of data is simpler with immutable objects, as they do not change state unexpectedly.

## 2. Improve Performance
 - **Concurrent Programming:** Immutable objects eliminate the need for synchronization in multi-threaded environments, reducing the risk of concurrency-related issues.
 - **Cache-Friendly:** Immutable objects can be safely cached and reused, potentially improving performance by avoiding redundant calculations or database queries.
