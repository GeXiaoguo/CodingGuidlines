# Rethinking OOP: Interfaces, Dependency Injection, and Mocking

## Introduction
In the evolving world of software development, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with interfaces and Dependency Injection (DI) has been a mainstay. While this approach can be beneficial in some cases, it has often been misapplied or overused, contributing to unnecessary software complexity. This article explores the challenges and limitations associated with interfaces, DI, and mocking in OOP, while highlighting a simpler alternative: pure functions.

## The Complexity of Interfaces and DI

### Understanding the Challenges
- **Runtime Complexity:** Interfaces and DI dictate that implementations are decided at runtime, which adds complexity and unpredictability to the codebase.
- **Obfuscation of Side Effects:** Interfaces, especially when combined with DI, can obscure whether an implementation causes side effects, complicating the separation of logic from side effects. This often results in I/O interfaces being injected into domain services, leading to logic and side effects being mixed together.

### Practical Implications
- **Increased Cognitive Load:** Understanding the system requires knowledge of not just the interfaces, but also the various implementations that might be injected at runtime. While interfaces and DI simplify individual implementations, they can obscure overall system behavior, especially when implementations are scattered across different libraries and repositories.
- **Documentation and Discipline:** Addressing these challenges necessitates rigorous documentation and disciplined coding practices, which are often difficult to maintain consistently.

## Testing and Mocking in OOP

### The Challenges with Mocking
- **Over-reliance on Mocks:** OOP's reliance on mocking frameworks for testing can lead to tests that focus more on implementation details than behavior.
- **Brittleness of Tests:** Tests heavily dependent on mocks can become brittle and less representative of real-world scenarios.

## Counterpoints: The Case for Pure Static Functions

### Advantages of Pure Static Functions
- **Predictability and Testability:** Pure static functions, being deterministic and devoid of side effects, offer a more predictable and testable alternative. Pure functions calling other pure functions form a tree of pure functions. The tree, as a whole, remains pure and can be tested as a single function without mocking any nodes.
- **Simplicity in Code:** A tree of pure static functions can be reasoned as a single function, significantly decreasing the cognitive load.
- **Promotes Separation of Logic and Side Effects:** Pure functions cannot handle side effects directly. Focusing on writing pure functions makes side effects explicit and apparent, facilitating their separation. The React framework exemplifies this: logic, state, and side effects are managed explicitly, not mixed together as class state and methods.

### Examples Demonstrating the Effectiveness of Pure Functions
- **The `Sum` Function and the '+' Operator in LINQ:** `Sum` can be tested with the actual implementation of the `+` operator instead of a mock. This makes the test much more valuable. As the behavior of `Sum` is purely dependent on the input, all behavior can be triggered by the input. This removes the need to mock the edge cases of the `+` operator in order to test `Sum`.
- **React Framework:** As a functional framework, React has successfully managed state and side effects in UI development, challenging the notion that OOP is inherently necessary for managing states and side effects.

## Conclusion

While OOP with interfaces and DI has its place in software development, it's important to critically evaluate these practices and consider alternatives like pure static functions. As demonstrated, pure functions offer clarity and ease of testing, underscoring the need for a balanced approach in software design. Embracing a paradigm that prioritizes simplicity and predictability can lead to more maintainable and understandable codebases.
